# NCHU WE-I Gooseï¼ŽSmith
## Smart elevator based on edge computing architecture combined with gesture recognition
## Introduction
This project combines the advantage of Himax WE-I Plus and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which are low-power comsumptioned and high efficiency respectively.Using cygwin to transfer the pretrained model into the version of Tensorflow lite, then detecting the hand movement by Himax WE-I Plus, depend on NVIDIA Jetson Nano to process the gesture recognition, send the recognition output to the server to control the elevator.
